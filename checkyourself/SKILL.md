description: Production-readiness diagnostics and guided remediation for AI-built apps using CheckYourself. Use when the user asks for a pre-launch audit, production readiness score, evidence-backed findings register, safest first fix batch, learning plan, optional dashboard, or a read-only reality check before shipping a repository, app, website, agent, MCP server, or AI-generated project.

# CheckYourself

## Overview

Use CheckYourself to turn an AI assistant into a calm, evidence-first production reviewer. Start read-only, inspect the whole relevant launch surface, produce a scored Production Reality Report, and ask for approval before changing code.

## Workflow

1. Identify the project and available CheckYourself context.
   - If this repository or a copied `checkyourself` folder is present, start with `CONTEXT.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `rules.md`, `02_RUN_DIAGNOSTIC/coverage-matrix.md`, and `02_RUN_DIAGNOSTIC/scoring-method.md`.
   - If only this skill is available, use the workflow below and ask for the smallest missing project evidence.
   - Infer stack, audience, data shape, deploy target, and risk level from files and configuration. Label guesses.

2. Run deterministic checks when safe and available.
   - Prefer read-only commands.
   - Each scan finding carries a stable, semantic rule ID (for example
     `CY-SECRET-001`, `CY-CONFIG-001`) that stays the same across runs, so you
     can suppress, diff, and cite findings reliably.
   - If `tools/checkyourself.py` exists, the deterministic pipeline is:

```bash
python3 tools/checkyourself.py describe --format json
python3 tools/checkyourself.py scan /path/to/project --deep --format json --no-write
python3 tools/checkyourself.py coverage --emit            # fill with evidence, then:
python3 tools/checkyourself.py score --findings scan.json --coverage coverage.json --format json
python3 tools/checkyourself.py backlog --findings scan.json --format json
python3 tools/checkyourself.py next --findings scan.json --format json
python3 tools/checkyourself.py diff --old baseline.json --new current.json --ci   # regression gate
```

   - Treat scanner findings as confirmed evidence. Do not invent a separate
     scoring or backlog path. If Python is unavailable, sweep manually and say
     the score is hand-computed.

3. Sweep the production surface.
   Cover product purpose, frontend UX, accessibility, backend/API behavior, auth, data storage, migrations, secrets, runtime config, tests, CI/CD, dependencies, deploy/rollback, observability, performance, privacy, compliance, and AI/RAG/agent governance when relevant.

4. Produce a Production Reality Report.
   Include:
   - executive summary;
   - what the app appears to do;
   - detected stack and confidence;
   - unknowns and assumptions;
   - Production Reality Score from 0 to 100 with severity caps explained
     (P0 caps at 49, P1 at 74, missing critical evidence at 84, missing
     launch-gate evidence at 90; the evidence caps apply even to estimates,
     and absence of findings is treated as Unknown, never an automatic Pass);
   - coverage sweep marked Pass, Finding, Unknown, or Not applicable;
   - P0/P1/P2/P3 findings;
   - evidence table;
   - complete ranked remediation backlog;
   - safest first approval batch;
   - questions that would change the diagnosis;
   - learning-plan seeds based on the actual gaps.

5. Recommend before acting.
   For each backlog item include finding ID, severity, fix summary, why it matters, likely files/systems touched, verification, rollback idea, learning value, and status. Do not modify files until the user approves a specific fix or batch.

6. After approval, run the guided fix loop.
   Make the smallest reversible change, verify it, update finding status, rescore when evidence changes, and continue until findings are fixed, accepted as risk, deferred with a reason, suppressed with evidence, or proven not applicable.

7. Create the learning plan.
   Tie lessons to the real findings and fixes. Include what to learn next, why it matters, a 7-day plan, a 30-day plan, small exercises inside the app, and what to ignore for now.

## Example Prompts

```text
Use $checkyourself to run a read-only production-readiness diagnostic for this app. Do not change code yet.
```

```text
Use $checkyourself to score this MCP server before launch, list every blocking unknown, and propose the safest first fix batch.
```

```text
Use $checkyourself on this website repo. After the report, make a learning plan from the gaps you found. dashboard inline.
```

## Safety Rules

- Start read-only.
- Do not change code, install dependencies, rotate secrets, touch production systems, or rewrite architecture without explicit approval.
- Do not stop at the first few issues. The first approval batch is only the first safe batch, not the full scope.
- Pass requires evidence. Finding requires evidence and risk. Unknown requires a question or evidence request. Not applicable requires a reason.
- Do not invent evidence or inflate the score.
- Do not paste long logs, source files, or reference docs back to the user unless needed.
- For regulated, financial, health, legal, life-safety, security-critical, or high-volume systems, recommend qualified expert review.
- Never ask for or expose live secrets, customer data, proprietary code, or unredacted `.env` values.

## Dashboard Modes

- Default: no dashboard.
- If the user says `dashboard yes`, create a self-contained HTML/CSS dashboard from the existing report. Do not rerun the audit just to make the dashboard.
- If the user says `dashboard inline`, produce a compact Markdown dashboard.

## Voice

Be direct, useful, and evidence-first. A light reality-check tone is fine, but aim the sharpness at the project state, never the person. For high-stakes findings, be blunt and calm.

Useful phrasing:

- "Demo-ready is not launch-ready. Here is the receipt."
- "This passes the happy path. Production does not grade on the happy path."
- "Not a disaster. Definitely a future incident with a calendar invite."
